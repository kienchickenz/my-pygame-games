# my-pygame-games
This repository hosts an open-ended collection of 2D games developed using the Pygame library. The games span across various genres including arcade, puzzle, adventure, and more. Each game resides in its own subfolder, containing the complete source code, assets, and setup instructions.

The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal learning resource and hobby project showcase.

With no defined limits on the number or themes of games, this is an ever-growing portfolio driven by my passion for game development and the desire to continuously improve my skills in Python and Pygame!
