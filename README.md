# Pygame Projects Collection

## Description

This repository hosts an open-ended collection of 2D games developed using the Pygame library. The games span across various genres including arcade, puzzle, adventure, and more. Each game resides in its own subfolder, containing the complete source code, assets, and setup instructions.

The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal learning resource and hobby project showcase.

With no defined limits on the number or themes of games, this is an ever-growing portfolio driven by my passion for game development and the desire to continuously improve my skills in Python and Pygame!

## Installation

### Python

Python is a popular programming language that can be installed on various operating systems. Here are the steps to install Python on your machine:

Windows
1. Visit the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/.
2. Download the latest version of Python by selecting the appropriate installer.
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
4. Make sure to select the option to add Python to your system's PATH during the installation process.

macOS
1. Visit the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/.
2. Download the latest version of Python by selecting the appropriate installer.
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

Linux
Python is usually pre-installed on most Linux distributions. However, if you need to install or update Python, you can use your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
```

After installing Python, you can verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following command:
```bash
python --version
```
This will display the version of Python installed on your system.

### Pygame

Pygame is a popular library for developing games and multimedia applications using Python. After installing Python, you can install Pygame by following these steps:

Windows
1. Open the command prompt by searching for "cmd" in the Start menu.
2. Run the following command to install Pygame:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

macOS and Linux
1. Open the terminal application.
2. Run the following command to install Pygame:
```bash
pip3 install pygame
```
Note: If you encounter any permission issues, try running the command with `sudo` prefix:
```bash
sudo pip3 install pygame
```
Once the installation is complete, you can verify the successful installation by opening a Python interpreter or script and importing the Pygame module:
```python
import pygame
```
If no error occurs, Pygame has been successfully installed, and you can start developing your games or multimedia applications using this library.

## Usage

After installing Python and Pygame, follow these steps to run the games in this repository:

1. **Download** or **clone** this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder you want to run.
3. Locate the main entry file (usually named `main.py` or something similar). This file may be present in the root directory of the project or inside a subdirectory like `code/`.
4. Once you have found the main entry file, open your terminal or command prompt, **navigate** to the directory containing the file, and run the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
Replace `main.py` with the actual filename if it's different.

5. The game should now launch and start running.

Repeat steps 2-5 for each project you want to run.

**Note:** Some projects may have additional setup instructions or requirements mentioned in their respective README files or directories. Be sure to check those before running the game.

## Credits

The game projects in this repository are developed by following along with the tutorials from YouTube channel **Clear Code** by Christian Koch. His clear explanations, well-structured lessons, and practical examples have been invaluable in learning game development with Python and Pygame.

Special thanks to Christian Koch for creating and sharing such high-quality educational content, which has been instrumental in the creation of these projects and the continuous improvement of my skills.
